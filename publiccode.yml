      TypeScript library for generating OpenDocument Format (.odt)
      files programmatically in Node.js.

    longDescription: >
      odf-kit is an open-source TypeScript library for generating
      OpenDocument Format (ODF) documents programmatically. It produces
      valid .odt files that open in LibreOffice, Apache OpenOffice, and
      any ODF-compliant application.


      Designed for developers building tools for governments, nonprofits,
      schools, and organisations that use open document standards, odf-kit
      provides a fluent, developer-friendly API for creating text documents
      with rich formatting, tables, lists, images, hyperlinks, bookmarks,
      headers and footers, and page layout control.


      Unlike abandoned alternatives such as simple-odf, odf-kit generates
      proper ZIP-packaged ODF files (not flat XML), supports tables with
      cell merging and formatting, embeds images, and is actively
      maintained. It has a single runtime dependency (JSZip) and targets
      Node.js 22+.


      odf-kit supports ODF 1.2+ (ISO/IEC 26300), the international
      standard for open document formats mandated by the European Union,
      Brazil, India, the United Kingdom, and many other jurisdictions
      for government interoperability and vendor independence.
